Installation
=============

The PCB is designed to be assembled to the extension port of the ‘normal’ SNES.
/Rst is a combination of a pad and a jumper, which can be used as follows:
– connect the pad with a wire to CIC pad 10 (animation is repeated on a reset using reset button and the IGR (PIC-microcontroller code)
– close jumper: animation is repeated on every reset (I do not like this, e.g., because the sd2snes performs a reset on startup and the animation is started a second time while the initial animation is running)
– neither connect the wire or the close the jumper: animation is just played once

- Fuse Bits for the ATTiny45: lfuse: 0xe2, hfuse:w:0xdf
- The given resistor values for the LEDs (2x 150Ohm (yellow, red) and 2x 100Ohm (green, blue)) are just examples. You may adjust these values according to your needs :)
- LEDs are in 0805 package.
